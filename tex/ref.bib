	Abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We construct a large, deep (Ks {\textless} 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of σΔz/(1+z) = 0.008 at i+ {\textless} 22.5 and σΔz/(1+z) = 0.03 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and starforming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being ``quenched'' in galaxies more massive than M 1010.7−10.9M . For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z {\textless} 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z ∼ 3 to z ∼ 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z ∼ 3 and z ∼ 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z {\textless} 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z {\textless} 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010−10.5M galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.},

@article{muzzin_evolution_2013,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 Ks-selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z ∼ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as ρstar ∝ (1 + z)−4.7$\pm$0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as ρstar ∝ (1 + z)−2.3$\pm$0.2. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(Mstar/M ) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(Mstar/M ) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

@article{moustakas_primus:_2013,
	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0--1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i {\textless} 23 flux-limited sample of ∼40,000 galaxies at z = 0.2--1.0 over five fields totaling ≈5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ∼170,000 galaxies at z = 0.01--0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30\% increase in the number density of ∼1010 M galaxies since z ≈ 0.6, and a 10\% change in the number density of all 1011 M galaxies since z ≈ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ∼1010 M star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z ≈ 0.6, whereas the space density of 1011 M star-forming galaxies decreases by ≈50\% between z ≈ 1 and z ≈ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ∼1010 M quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ∼2--3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ∼1010.8 M . In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z {\textless} 1, even among massive ( 1011 M ) quiescent galaxies.},

@article{tomczak_galaxy_2014,
	Abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1--2 μm. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ∼109.5 M at z ∼ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses {\textless}1010 M that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ∼ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M∗) and slope at the lowest masses (α) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M ) ∼ 10.65 and ∼−1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M ) has increased by a factor of ∼12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ∼2.2.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 A˚ across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 A˚ for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A˚ to 160 µm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour--magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},
