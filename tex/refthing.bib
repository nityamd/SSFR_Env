	abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We construct a large, deep (Ks {\textless} 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we ﬁnd a precision of σΔz/(1+z) = 0.008 at i+ {\textless} 22.5 and σΔz/(1+z) = 0.03 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We ﬁnd a mass-dependent evolution of the global and starforming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being “quenched” in galaxies more massive than M 1010.7−10.9M . For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant evolution of the high-mass end at z {\textless} 1; however we observe a clear ﬂattening of the faint-end slope. From z ∼ 3 to z ∼ 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z ∼ 3 and z ∼ 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z {\textless} 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z {\textless} 1.5, while we ﬁnd diﬀerences of 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the speciﬁc star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We ﬁnd that the speciﬁc star formation rate of 1010−10.5M galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and ﬁnd that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 Ks-selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA ﬁeld. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z ∼ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as ρstar ∝ (1 + z)−4.7±0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as ρstar ∝ (1 + z)−2.3±0.2. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at ﬁxed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(Mstar/M ) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(Mstar/M ) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and ﬁnd that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the deﬁnition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},
